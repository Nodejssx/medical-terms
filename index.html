          HealthSpeak is an educational app. It does not provide medical or clinical advice and is not a substitute for professional diagnosis or treatment. In case of a medical emergency, call your local emergency number immediately.
        </div>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of HealthSpeak – Medical English (the “App”). By downloading, accessing, or using the App, you agree to these Terms and our <a href="#privacy">Privacy Policy</a>. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

        <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age in your country) to use the App. If you are under the age of majority, you may use the App only with the consent and supervision of a parent or legal guardian.</p>

        <h2>3. Educational Use Only – No Medical Advice</h2>
        <p>The App provides language learning content for medical contexts for educational purposes only. It is not intended to provide medical, diagnostic, or treatment advice. We do not warrant the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of any medical-related content.</p>

        <h2>4. Accounts and Access</h2>
        <p>You are responsible for safeguarding your device and any credentials used to access the App. You must not share accounts or misuse the App in ways that violate these Terms or applicable laws.</p>

        <h2>5. Subscriptions, Trials, and In‑App Purchases</h2>
        <p>Some features require an auto‑renewing subscription or one‑time in‑app purchase through Apple’s in‑app purchase system. Prices are displayed in the App and may vary by region, currency, or promotional offer.</p>
        <h3>Auto‑Renewal</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Payment is charged to your Apple ID at confirmation of purchase.</li>
          <li>Subscriptions renew automatically unless auto‑renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.</li>
          <li>Your account is charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.</li>
          <li>You can manage or cancel your subscription at any time in your iOS Settings: <em>Settings › Your Name › Subscriptions</em>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Free Trials</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Any free trial converts to a paid subscription unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the trial ends.</li>
          <li>Any unused portion of a free trial is forfeited when you purchase a subscription.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Refunds</h3>
        <p>Refunds for in‑app purchases and subscriptions are handled by Apple. For refund requests, visit <a href="https://reportaproblem.apple.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportaproblem.apple.com</a>.</p>

        <h2>6. Content and License</h2>
        <p>We grant you a personal, limited, revocable, non‑transferable license to use the App for your own non‑commercial, educational purposes. All content, trademarks, and materials in the App are owned by us or our licensors.</p>

        <h2>7. User Conduct</h2>
        <p>You agree not to misuse the App, including by attempting to reverse‑engineer, copy, resell, scrape, or circumvent access controls, or by uploading unlawful, harmful, or infringing material.</p>

        <h2>8. Third‑Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App may integrate third‑party services (e.g., analytics, paywall/subscription frameworks such as Superwall, subscription management via RevenueCat, and sign‑in or attribution SDKs). Your use of those services is subject to their respective terms and policies.</p>

        <h2>9. Privacy</h2>
        <p id="privacy">We collect and process data in accordance with our Privacy Policy. By using the App, you consent to such processing. Please review our Privacy Policy for details on data types, purposes, and your rights.</p>

        <h2>10. Changes to the App and Terms</h2>
        <p>We may modify features, pricing, or these Terms at any time. Material changes will be communicated in‑app or via update notes. Your continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>

        <h2>11. Disclaimers and Liability</h2>
        <p>The App is provided “as is” without warranties of any kind. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all implied warranties and shall not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages.</p>

        <h2>12. Termination</h2>
        <p>We may suspend or terminate access for violations of these Terms or unlawful activity. You may stop using the App at any time; deleting the App does not cancel active subscriptions—manage them in iOS Settings.</p>

        <h2>13. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of your country or region of residence, without regard to conflict of laws principles. Local consumer protection rights remain unaffected.</p>

        <h2>14. Contact</h2>
        <p>Questions? Contact us at <a href="mailto:support@yourdomain.com">support@yourdomain.com</a>. Please include your Apple ID (masked) and device details where relevant.</p>
